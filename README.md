Hello, welcome to our University of Regina CS 476 group project! It is tentatively referred to as "Farmer's Favourite". 

Our project is an e-commerce plant store with a twist! Our twist is that our application will take the user's address and overlay it with a map of the Canadian eco-reigons so we can reccomend plants that are native to your area. (Currently this ability is only limited to Saskatchewan). Our application will also check to see how well your plants will coexist and inform you if there is potential hiccups to be expected!

To run this application you will need to run the commands below:

// If you already have NPM installed then you can use the command "npm install" to download all the react dependecies you will need
1. Please note: You need to download NPM (to run commands) and some React plugins (which can be found in the project's "package.js"). Otherwise, the program will not run.
2. To compile and run the front-end part command: npm run frontend
3. To compile and run the back-end part command: npm run backend
or
4. To compile the front-end and back-end simultaneously you can use the command: npm run dev
